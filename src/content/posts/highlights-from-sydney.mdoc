𝗛𝗮𝗽𝗽𝘆 𝗗𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲! What in the world is a bin chicken?\
\
\
So apparently I made it this far and now I'm actually writing my own blog post about doing research in Sydney. Crazy to think about, especially remembering last year this time around I was preparing to start Penn's PFP (Pre First Year) program reminiscing about what it would be like to potentially over the course of the next 4 years get to spend a summer abroad somewhere very far away from home.\
\
Turns out Australia is probably the only kind of place where Jurassic Park is still a possibility. As soon as we landed at the airport and grouped up together to head over to our housing, we were warmly greeted by this mystically looking bird. \
\
𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗕𝗜𝗡 𝗖𝗛𝗜𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗡.\
\
It's pretty ironic considering all the banter you'd get about Australia having the wildest animals in the world and this is your first welcoming. You think you're just walking to get coffee and suddenly there's this prehistoric-looking bird staring you down like you owe it money.\
\
Jokes aside, these guys are harmless. They're just Australia's version of pigeons that are lowkey pretty chill just like the people here.\
\
Australians are just... chill. Like aggressively chill. Whatever type of problem they find themselves in, it's always "𝙃𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙮 𝙙𝙖𝙮𝙨".\
\
Another big thing here is humor. It's the nonchalant type of humor, unlike some places where people sweat just to bring out a laugh. They are in my opinion bon mot specialists. Let them talk, in a couple of sentences you'll be cracking up without even realizing it.\
\
Yeah, the iconic Australian savory Nutella. Vegemite. Tried it. Obviously had to. \
\
If you are low on your sodium intake for the day this might just be your best friend. Although more like a younger cousin that makes questionable life choices that somehow drag you down with him leaving a weird taste. But on another note it's got pretty good macros in terms of your B vitamins which some people struggle to get into their diet.\
\
Random Sydney thoughts at 10PM (yes here you somehow naturally tend to go to bed earlier, don't know what it is but my sleep schedule has been revived here):\
\
⚫ Why is air here so good like it doesn't smell bad anywhere in the city this is mind blowing\
\
⚫ Everyone really does say "Happy days" and mean it\
\
⚫ The Sydney Opera House is much bigger in the pictures but still mesmerizing in person\
\
⚫ Still haven't seen a single kangaroo in the city (disappointing, really disappointing although we'll be heading to the zoo this weekend so yay!)\
\
\
Anyway… that's the update. Living in Sydney, being casual about everything. \
\
The Australian way is rubbing off on me I guess.\
