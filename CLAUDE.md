# lukaadzic.dev

## What this is

Luka Adzic's personal portfolio. One page (`/`) plus a `/404`. The UI is a
faithful, interactive macOS Terminal window built around **prompt-driven
discovery**. The window is **fullscreen by default** (edge-to-edge, square
corners, sticky title bar, content capped to a readable ~900px column); the
green traffic light zooms it down to the floating windowed look and back,
remembered per tab via `sessionStorage` (the `/404` card always floats). On
load only a short `welcome` greeting types out and stays
pinned at the top, then the visitor reveals content by prompting — typing
commands or clicking the suggestion chips under the prompt (`about`,
`projects`, `github`, `socials`, `cv`, and an accented `./everything.sh`).
The chips act as a segmented tab bar: the chip for whatever command is
currently displayed reads as active/brighter, every other chip stays in a
clearly-clickable resting state — there is no "already run" dimming. The
prompt is `lukaadzic ~ %`. `about` renders as a neofetch-style key/value info
card (name, school, location, live age, focus, project count, contact,
socials — all sourced from `lib/site.ts` / `lib/projects.ts`), and `cv` opens
the résumé in a new tab. Supported commands include `help`, `whoami`,
`email`, `age`, `pwd`, `ls` (fake home dir; `ls ~/projects` lists project
slugs), `echo <text>`, `date` (client-evaluated, never SSR'd), `history`
(this session's commands), a `sudo` easter egg, `clear`, and command history
via arrow keys — plus Tab-completion of partial input against known
commands. Unknown commands occasionally get a sassier
`command not found` message (1-in-3). A handful of personality easter eggs
(`giveon`/`beloved`, `vatreni`, `modric`) hide as dotfiles discoverable via
`ls -la`; their content lives in `lib/easter-eggs.ts` and must stay verified
fact, never invented. On the home page the red traffic light refuses to
close: a macOS-style "don't leave." alert opens over the window with
Giveon's DON'T LEAVE autoplaying inside it, and `leave anyway` loses its
nerve twice before conceding — all alert copy is original, never verbatim
lyrics; the `/404` card keeps the plain shake + toast. So the track starts
the instant the alert opens rather than after a script fetch,
`terminal-window.tsx` warms Spotify's iFrame API script during idle time
after mount and again on the first pointerover/focus of the traffic-light
group — `loadSpotifyIframeApi()` is a safe no-op once already loaded, and
warming never itself plays audio. The pinned
`welcome` block opens with
a block-letter ASCII banner of the FULL name (built from a tiny per-letter
glyph map in `welcome-output.tsx`, `aria-hidden` with an `sr-only` text
alternative); below 640px the banner stays block-letter but stacks
first/last name on two lines so it never wraps — Luka explicitly wants the
banner present at every screen size, never collapsed to plain text. There is deliberately no photo, and the GitHub
graph renders as a terminal-native block sparkline. The terminal aesthetic
and the reveal-by-prompting interaction ARE the product — preserve them in
every change; don't "improve" it into a generic component library look or
an auto-playing content dump.

## Stack & commands

Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind v4, TypeScript (strict), Biome
as the only linter/formatter. **Bun only** — never introduce npm/yarn
lockfiles or ESLint.

```
bun install
bun dev              # next dev --turbopack
bun run build
bun run lint         # biome check .
bun run lint:fix      # biome check . --write
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
```

## Architecture

```
app/
  layout.tsx          metadata + JSON-LD Person schema (derived from lib/)
  page.tsx            renders TerminalWindow > TerminalSession
  not-found.tsx        404 page (NotFoundTerminal)
  api/github-contributions/route.ts   GitHub GraphQL proxy
components/
  terminal/           window chrome (terminal-window.tsx), the typing/session
                       engine (terminal-session.tsx), the command registry +
                       renderers (commands.tsx), and one output component per
                       command (about-output, whoami-output, projects-output,
                       socials-output, github-output, help-output, ...)
  shared/              components reused across terminal outputs (e.g.
                       external-link.tsx)
lib/                   single source of truth for all content
  site.ts              identity, metadata, email, GitHub username, birth date,
                       school/location/focus
  projects.ts          project list
  socials.ts           social links
  github-contributions.ts   contribution-level + fallback-data helpers
```

**Data flow:** `lib/*.ts` -> server-rendered `page.tsx` (window chrome + an
`sr-only` SEO content block) -> client `TerminalSession`, which drives the
welcome animation, suggestion chips, and interactive prompt.
`app/layout.tsx`'s metadata and JSON-LD are derived from `lib/site.ts` and
`lib/socials.ts`, never hand-duplicated.

**Key invariant:** all content (identity, projects, socials, GitHub logic)
lives in `lib/`. Components and UI code never hardcode copy — they import
it. The command registry in `commands.tsx` maps each command to a
`Renderer`; chips, typed input, and `./everything.sh` all resolve through
that same registry, so every path renders identical output.
`./everything.sh` is a single renderer that stacks every section (about
card, projects, github sparkline, socials) into one combined output — "the
whole rundown" as one command, not a scripted replay.

## Principles

- **Server-first.** `"use client"` only where state or browser APIs are
  required. Actual client components today: `terminal-session.tsx` (typing
  state machine, input handling, chips), `terminal-window.tsx` (window
  chrome interactions), `not-found-terminal.tsx` (reads `usePathname`),
  `live-age.tsx` (ticking age display), `github-contributions.tsx` +
  `github-contributions-lazy.tsx` (client fetch, lazy-loaded with
  `next/dynamic` and `ssr: false`).
- **DRY outputs.** Anything rendered more than once (chip vs. typed command
  vs. `./everything.sh` tour) becomes a shared renderer/component — never
  copy a block just to tweak it.
- **Motion.** CSS-only (plus small inline-style transitions driven by React
  state for the exact swap timings below), gated behind
  `prefers-reduced-motion` (instant, no animation). No JS animation
  libraries. The pinned `welcome` block is mounted (at `opacity: 0`) from
  first paint so its final height is reserved immediately — it only fades in
  (~320ms) once the typed `welcome` beat finishes, so there is zero layout
  shift as the opening sequence plays out. The session then shows that
  `welcome` block plus exactly one command group below it — never a
  stacking log. Running a new command fades the currently displayed group
  out (~120ms), types the new command at the prompt, then fades its output
  up (~280ms, `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`); `clear` fades the current
  group out and leaves the welcome-only state. `.terminal-group-container`
  additionally smooths the resulting height change via `interpolate-size`
  where supported. The window itself opens with a fade; in fullscreen (the
  default, and the common mobile state) that's opacity + a small
  `translateY` only, since scaling a full-viewport element forces a
  whole-page repaint every frame — floating mode and the `/404` card, being
  small elements, keep the original ~350ms scale(0.98→1) + fade
  (`cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1)`). The suggestion chips fade in with a
  ~40ms stagger right after the welcome beat finishes, and chips get a
  subtle `scale(0.97)` on press.
- **System font, no webfonts.** `--font-mono` / `--font-sans` in
  `app/globals.css` are OS font stacks (`ui-monospace`, `SF Mono`, etc.) —
  no `next/font`, no bundled font files. On Apple devices this renders the
  actual Terminal.app font.
- **No `!important`.**
- **SSR-first SEO.** The visible terminal starts nearly empty, so
  `page.tsx` also renders `components/terminal/seo-content.tsx` — an
  `sr-only` server-rendered block with the full content (name, about,
  project links, social links, email, resume) derived from `lib/`. Keep it
  in sync when adding content sections.
- **No new dependencies without a strong reason.** Currently 4 runtime deps
  (`next`, `react`, `react-dom`, `@vercel/analytics`). Justify any addition.

## Git & attribution

- Commits are authored by Luka only. Never add `Co-Authored-By` trailers,
  "Generated with" footers, robot emoji, or anything else that signals AI
  involvement — in commits, PR titles/descriptions, or issue text.
- Write commit subjects and PR descriptions in Luka's voice: short, direct,
  lowercase-casual is fine ("fix chip highlight", "rework github graph").
  One commit per logical change — he wants each change to count individually.
- Merges to `main` preserve individual commits (rebase merge, never squash).

## Security practices

- The `/api/github-contributions` route serves **only** the allowlisted
  username (`SITE.githubUsername`) — any other value, or one failing the
  GitHub username regex, is rejected with 400.
- Errors are always sanitized: on any upstream failure the route returns
  fallback data with `isFallback: true`, never the raw upstream error text.
- Successful responses are CDN-cached for 1h
  (`s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400`) under a single cache key —
  that caching *is* the rate limiting. Don't add a serverless in-memory
  limiter; it resets per invocation and does nothing.
- Security headers + CSP live in `next.config.ts`. When adding any
  third-party script or API call, update `script-src` / `connect-src` in the
  CSP there — don't relax it globally.
- Secrets live only in `.env` (local) or the Vercel dashboard (prod), never
  as `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, and `.env` is gitignored — never commit it. See
  `.env.example` for the required keys.

## Verification checklist

- `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run build` all clean.
- Manual pass of `/`: welcome types out and stays pinned, suggestion chips
  execute their commands and show the active one as brighter (never
  dimmed), `./everything.sh` shows the combined rundown as one output,
  typed commands + history work, the github sparkline spans the full content
  width at desktop and ~390px with no horizontal scroll,
  `prefers-reduced-motion` disables typing animation and cursor blink.
- Manual pass of `/404`.
- `curl` the API route: a valid username returns 200 with `Cache-Control`
  set; an invalid/mismatched username returns 400.
