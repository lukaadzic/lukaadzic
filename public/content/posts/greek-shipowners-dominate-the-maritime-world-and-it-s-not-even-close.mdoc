This month, I had the chance to hop on a few calls with Greek shipowners, and it became crystal clear why Greece remains the world’s leading shipowning nation.\
\
The secret? Hands-on leadership.\
\
In every conversation, one thing stood out: the owner or founder isn’t just a name on the board. They’re the beating heart of their companies:\
\
✔ First in the office, last to leave.\
✔ Watching, engaging, and driving excellence.\
✔ Recognizing and rewarding the talent that goes the extra mile.\
\
It’s a reminder for all leaders, no matter the industry: Leadership isn’t just about vision; it’s about being present. By staying involved, you build a culture of accountability, reward excellence, and set a standard that inspires others to follow.\
\
Greece leading the maritime world isn’t luck...it’s leadership done right.
