You’re holding on to something that’s not working. You know it. You feel it. But you won’t drop it. That tension in your head? That’s cognitive dissonance.

It’s common. Especially for founders. And it slows you down.

Here’s how it shows up:

- You lose sleep. Something feels wrong, but changing direction feels worse.
- Feedback annoys you. You defend instead of listening. You preach instead of reflecting.
- You live in hope mode. Every “almost” win keeps you hooked. You wait for luck instead of changing the game.

Sound familiar?

Here’s how to break the cycle:

- Listen first. Always. In meetings, let others speak. You’ll learn faster. You’ll catch flaws in your thinking.
- Change in small steps. Don’t shock your system. Start tiny. Build momentum. Win through consistency.
- Drop dead ideas. If a vertical isn’t working, stop. Test something else. Action leads to clarity. Clinging delays it.

Founders succeed by adjusting fast. You don’t need to be right. \

You just need to be real.
