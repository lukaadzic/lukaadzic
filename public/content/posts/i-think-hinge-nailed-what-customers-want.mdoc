Most brands fight to keep you addicted.\
\
They use dopamine loops. FOMO. Infinite scroll.\
\
Red Bull launched a man from space.\
Old Spice made insecurity go viral.\
\
Hinge did the opposite.\
\
They want you to delete the app.\
\
Their goal is simple. Help you find someone, then get out of the way.\
\
That message builds trust.\
That trust builds loyalty.\
That loyalty brings people back.\
\
You don’t need to chase retention when the problem keeps coming back.\
\
Solve the problem.\
Disappear.\
Repeat.\
\
That’s how Hinge wins.\
\
Not every business should aim to keep you forever.\
Sometimes, winning once is enough.
