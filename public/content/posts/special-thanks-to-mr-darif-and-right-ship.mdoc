Wow. What an event. And what a speaker.\
\
A huge thank you to Mr. [**Oussama Darif**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oussama-darif-a3259832/) for flying out to Philly to join us at [**The Wharton School**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-wharton-school/), [**University of Pennsylvania**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/university-of-pennsylvania/) and for sharing his life and career journey with such clarity and insight. I think everyone on our team walked away with a deeper, more practical understanding of the maritime industry.\
\
This guest lecture was a testament to the maritime industry’s commitment to reaching out to young people and introducing them to this dynamic and essential sector.\

𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝘄𝗮𝘀𝗻’𝘁 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘆, 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝗶𝘁 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗱𝗼𝗼𝗿𝘀 𝗜 𝗱𝗶𝗱𝗻’𝘁 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗲𝘅𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱.\
\
Events like these are especially impactful at universities like [**The Wharton School**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-wharton-school/), where students often have little exposure to the industry or the opportunities it offers. While a similar talk at a maritime college would certainly be valuable, bringing these discussions into new spaces opens doors for students who might never have considered careers in shipping. \
\
A big shoutout to Mr. [**Steen Lund**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steen-lund-4b50061/), CEO of [**RightShip**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/rightship-group-pte-ltd/), whom I initially reached out to and who connected me with Mr. Darif. It’s been a true pleasure, and we at [**Maritime@Penn (MAP)**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pennmaritime/) are genuinely impressed by what you and your team are accomplishing at RightShip.\
\
RightShip is the real deal, and we at Wharton are fully convinced that you will achieve your vision of transforming the maritime industry into one that causes zero harm.\
\
Mr. Darif’s lecture reinforced that maritime is anything but outdated or uninteresting, it’s an industry led by modern, knowledgeable, and engaging professionals. His talk sparked meaningful discussions, generated real interest, and reminded us that the industry’s future depends on bridging the gap between academia and real-world maritime innovation. I have no doubt that some students will be inspired to pursue careers in this field because of speakers like him. \
\
As the industry evolves, moments like these are more than just conversations...they are a passing of the torch. The knowledge, experience, and passion shared by seasoned professionals light the way for the next generation, ensuring that maritime remains a driving force in the global economy. Those who have built this industry can be confident that they are handing it over to young, driven individuals ready to carry it forward. \
\
And, of course, a special thank you to [**Amy Qian**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengqingqian/) and Sinful Donut Lab for providing the most delicious and healthy donuts for this event! If you haven’t tried Sinful Donut Lab yet, you’re seriously missing out! \

Once again, thank you all. Looking forward to working on more exciting projects like these in the future.
