Well, I just wrapped up a wild 4-day adventure in the NYC startup ecosystem... here's what I think:\
\
The "Hinge model" of success: Some startups define success as making their product unnecessary. This flips the script on traditional growth metrics and forces us to rethink what "scaling" really means. I'll be covering more on this in a future post, as this kinda blows my mind and feels like it deserves more attention. Stay tuned!\
\
Ecosystem over ego: The top founders I met? They're not just building companies - they're actively shaping the ecosystem and tackling real-world issues. Community involvement isn't some chore for them; it's a strategic move. They're all about creating stuff people want, but with an eye on what the world actually needs.\
\
Live, laugh, love, but also make sure you build: The big lesson? Have fun, experiment, and let serendipity work its magic. You never know when you'll stumble upon the next big idea. It's less about forcing innovation and more about creating the right environment for it to flourish. Sometimes, going headfirst without a plan can take you really far, but you must make sure that even if you're stepping aside from academics or a safer professional pathway, you're utilizing every day and moment to the fullest. Because at the end of the day, time is money, and in the startup world, it's the most precious resource you've got.\
\
PEOPLE, PEOPLE, PEOPLE: Yeah, it sounds cliché, but this truth needs shouting from the rooftops. For early-stage startups, I've seen firsthand that the right team can make or break your chances - we're talking over 75% of your success potential right there. Now, here are my three big "don'ts":

1. Don't team up with people who drive you nuts. Life's too short, and startups are too hard.
1. Don't shy away from creating and running a startup with your family just because VCs get twitchy. Siblings, parents - if you've got that magic combo, go for it. Plenty have proved the skeptics wrong.
1. Don't do it for the money; it only takes you so far. If it’s your team’s main flame keeping you going, hate to break it to you, but you're probably in for a very rough ride.\
